## Revisiting NN from Scratch:
  - Implementing basic Neural Network from Scratch, following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU) or this Kaggle [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wwsalmon/simple-mnist-nn-from-scratch-numpy-no-tf-keras/notebook).
  - BackProp: [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8) or [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyn2zdALii8&pp=ygUPYmFja3Byb3BhZ2F0aW9u).
  - Vectorizing: [Notes](https://gist.github.com/AusafMo/61ba7ba228f2ccbdb0c565771f766eb3)  
### To-Do:
- [ ] Upload a vectorized version, already implemented in Andrew Ng course. 
- [ ] Implement in C++, don't ask me why.

#### Some pointers to future me : 

- [ ] Use [Armadillo](https://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html) as a NumPy substitute, look [here (SO Link)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11169418/numpy-style-arrays-for-c). <br> 
- [ ] Figure out CSV reading, look [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1120140/how-can-i-read-and-parse-csv-files-in-c), well i can probably hardcode the data as a vector, but still.
